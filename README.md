##Wave Function Collapse - University Project

[Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/) is an algorithm invented by Maxim Gumin. This repository is a university project in which I researched, implemented an optimized the algorithm for a seminar and a [paper (in German language)](https://github.com/tnoell/wfc/raw/master/Documentation/WaveFunctionCollapse.pdf).
The project can be built using GNU make on Linux (requires libpng). Run via command line with optional arguments: main \[height\] \[width\] \[repetitions (for benchmark)\] \[.tileset file\]
Example outputs from given tilesets:
