## Wave Function Collapse - University Project

[Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/) is a procedural generation algorithm invented by Maxim Gumin. This repository is a university project in which I researched, implemented an optimized the algorithm for a seminar and a [paper (in German language)](https://github.com/tnoell/wfc/raw/master/Documentation/WaveFunctionCollapse.pdf).<br />
The project can be built using GNU make on Linux (simply run `make`, requires libpng). Run via command line with optional arguments:<br />
```main [height] [width] [repetitions (for benchmark)] [.tileset file]```<br />
<br />
Example outputs from given tilesets:
